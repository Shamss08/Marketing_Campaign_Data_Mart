# Marketing Campaign Data Mart
## Overview
This project is designed to implement a Marketing Campaign Data Mart that is built with a Star Schema and utilizes Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to track historical changes. The data mart sources data from an Excel file [Marketing_Campaign_Analysis_Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/Shamss08/Marketing_Campaign_Data_Mart/blob/main/Marketing_Campaign_Analysis_Dataset.xlsx), which is processed using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations. The data mart is hosted in SQL Server and is structured for efficient querying and reporting.
